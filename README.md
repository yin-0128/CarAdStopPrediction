# Radio Ad Effectiveness Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements machine learning models to predict whether a car driver will stop by a local store after hearing a promotion advertisement on the car radio. The results can be useful in evaluating the effectiveness of **in-vehicle radio advertising**.

The dataset (`dataset.csv`) contains driver behavior and visit patterns, and the goal is to classify whether the driver will actually visit the store.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **data exploration** and **preprocessing**  
- Train and evaluate **classification models**  
- Compare model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
- Provide insights into advertising effectiveness
